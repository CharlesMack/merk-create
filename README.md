### **About**

The Merk Creative Kit is our answer to a market saturated with simple recording apps. It's a throwback to the "good old days" of intentional, curated content creation, but with the power of promising new technology. It empowers new and professional users alike to visualize, plan, and capture their artistic vision with unprecedented ease and control. We believe that the best creative tools are those that enhance the user's skills, not replace them. With the Merk Creative Kit, you can master professional techniques from **Continuity Editing** to **Anamorphic De-squeeze** before you ever press record.
